### The tentative project title

Digital Attention Attenuation: A Multi-Platform Study of Short-Form Video Viewer Patience

### The motivation for this project

#### 1. Historical background: Attention as a new currency

In the digital age of information explosion, human attention has become a scarce and fiercely contested "new currency". Short-video platforms, especially YouTube Shorts and TikTok, have completely reshaped the landscape of content consumption through their short, flat and fast features, and have raised widespread social concerns about **the systematic shortening of human attention spans**. We are at a crucial crossroads: How can content form, in turn, shape our cognitive habits? Understanding and quantifying this change is not only the need of academic research, but also an important review of the current digital cultural ecosystem.

#### 2. Industry pain point: The paradigm shift from "viewership" to "completion rate"

Traditional video success metrics (such as views and likes) are no longer sufficient to reveal the deep truth of user behavior. Industry practice shows that the recommendation algorithms of platforms are increasingly inclined towards a more persuasive metric: completion rate. It is widely regarded as the gold standard for measuring whether a video truly captures and maintains the audience's attention.

However, a core contradiction emerges accordingly:

* The Creator's Dilemma: Should content become shorter and shorter in pursuit of high completion rates? Is there still a "golden duration" that can maximize the audience's patience?

* Platform competition: Are there systematic differences in the attention and patience thresholds among users of different platforms (such as TikTok and YouTube Shorts)?

* Cognitive impact: Is this extreme pursuit of "brevity" irreversibly reshaping users' expectations and patience levels?

#### 3. Research gap: Lack of quantitative and comparative empirical analysis

* Although "shortened attention span" has become a common consensus, there are still obvious gaps in rigorous academic and industry research:
Lack of precise correlation: Few existing studies can precisely depict the quantitative relationship curve between video duration and completion rate based on massive amounts of data.

* Lack of cross-platform perspective: Most analyses are confined to a single platform and fail to reveal how the ecosystems of different platforms differently shape user behavior.
Lack of dynamic perspective: Against the backdrop of the rapid evolution of short video content, we need a snapshot of the current situation based on the latest data (such as 2025) to capture the behavioral characteristics of users at the current stage.

### The intended final products

Our final deliverable will be an interactive data-driven webpage, designed to uncover key patterns behind short video performance across platforms, creators, and content types. The site will contain seven major analytical modules on the Home page: 

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Visualization Panel: Interactive visualizations including histograms, correlation matrices, scatter plots, boxplots, and line charts etc, to reveal the distribution and relationships among core engagement metrics (e.g., completion rate, interaction rate, views, and duration).

* Regression Analysis Panel: Statistical modeling to identify key factors associated with video completion rate and engagement rate. Models such as multiple linear regression and generalized models will quantify how variables such as duration, platform, and category influence these outcomes.

* Group Comparison Analysis: Comparative analyses across content, durations or creator categories to determine how performance metrics differ between subgroups, visualized through grouped boxplots and summary tables.

* Machine Learning Prediction Models: Predictive modeling using Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost to estimate completion rate based on content and creator attributes. Feature importance charts will highlight which factors most strongly drive engagement and retention.

* Practical Recommendations Module: A synthesis of findings providing actionable insights for content creators and marketers — for example, suggesting optimal video durations, category strategies, or engagement-enhancing practices based on the data-driven evidence.

Each section will include visual outputs (ggplot2, plotly, and leaflet etc.), model summaries, and interpretations or comments, with all materials hosted as a collaborative GitHub-based website. The written report and a 2-minute screencast will summarize key methodologies and recommendations.

### The anticipated data sources

The project will rely on a multi-dimensional dataset about social media trend data for 2025 from [kaggle website](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tarekmasryo/youtube-shorts-and-tiktok-trends-2025). These data files are already provided and include:

* `country_platform_summary_2025.csv`: Country-level performance metrics (engagement rate, reach, views, post counts) across platforms such as TikTok and YouTube.

* `monthly_trends_2025.csv`: Monthly-level temporal trends capturing seasonality and growth patterns.

* `top_creators_impact_2025.csv`: Profiles of the top 1,000 creators with detailed performance metrics, used to model completion and engagement factors.

* `top_hashtags_2025.csv`: Popular hashtags and related engagement trends, used for thematic and content-level analyses.

* `DATA_DICTIONARY.csv`: Metadata defining variable meanings to ensure consistent interpretation and reproducibility.

* `youtube_shorts_tiktok_trends_2025.csv`: Comprehensive raw dataset containing creator-level performance data across platforms, regions, and content categories with detailed engagement metrics, traffic sources, device distributions, and temporal posting patterns.

* `youtube_shorts_tiktok_trends_2025.csv_ML.csv`: Machine learning-ready processed dataset with engineered features, encoded categorical variables, and normalized metrics optimized for predictive modeling and algorithm training.

All files are structured in `.csv` format and will be processed in R using packages such as `tidyverse`, `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `plotly`. The combination of geographic, temporal, and creator-level data enables both statistical inference and machine learning modeling to understand and predict short video performance on different platforms. 

### The planned analyses and visualizations
#### Exploratory Data Analysis
- Visualize the distribution of core performance metrics (completion rate and engagement rate) using histograms, density plots, and boxplots.<br/>
<div style="margin-bottom: 10px;"></div>
- Use scatter plots and correlation heat maps to examine relationships among different video characteristics and their performance results.

#### Regression Analysis
- Apply multiple regression models to identify which video characteristics significantly influence completion rate and engagement rate.<br/>

- Interpret coefficient direction and magnitude to understand how content attributes affect viewer retention and interaction.

#### Group Comparison Analysis
- Compare performance across different video content categories such as lifestyle, sport and music.<br/>
<div style="margin-bottom: 10px;"></div>
- Conduct duration-based subgroup comparisons by categorizing videos into length intervals (e.g., <15s, 15–30s, 30–60s, >60s) to evaluate how video duration affects viewer retention and determine whether there is an optimal video length range that maximizes completion rate and engagement performance.

- visualize feature importance rankings to determine which content attributes contribute most strongly to viewer behavior.

### Coding challenges
1.Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

The dataset likely contains missing values, skewed variables, and outliers. Designing a systematic cleaning pipeline while keeping the app dynamic (so users can view the effect of filters or group selections in real-time) can be challenging.

2.Regression and Model Comparison Implementation

Running multiple models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) requires careful parameter tuning and consistent data splitting. Comparing model performance and extracting feature importance for interpretability in R can be computationally intensive.

3.Visualization Consistency and Interactivity

The EDA and group comparison sections require various plots (correlation heatmaps, boxplots, scatter plots, line plots). Maintaining a consistent color scheme, responsive layout, and interactive features (e.g., hover info, variable selection) will require thoughtful ggplot2 + plotly + Shiny integration.
