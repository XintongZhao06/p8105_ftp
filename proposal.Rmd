## The tentative project title

Digital Attention Attenuation: A Multi-Platform Study of Short-Form Video Viewer Patience

## The motivation for this project

#### 1. Historical background: Attention as a new currency

In the digital age of information explosion, human attention has become a scarce and fiercely contested "new currency". Short-video platforms, especially YouTube Shorts and TikTok, have completely reshaped the landscape of content consumption through their short, flat and fast features, and have raised widespread social concerns about the systematic shortening of human attention spans. We are at a crucial crossroads: How can content form, in turn, shape our cognitive habits? Understanding and quantifying this change is not only the need of academic research, but also an important review of the current digital cultural ecosystem.

#### 2. Research gap: Lack of quantitative and comparative empirical analysis

* Although "shortened attention span" has become a common consensus, there are still obvious gaps in rigorous academic and industry research:
Lack of precise correlation: Few existing studies can precisely depict the quantitative relationship curve between video duration and completion rate based on massive amounts of data.

* Lack of cross-platform perspective: Most analyses are confined to a single platform and fail to reveal how the ecosystems of different platforms differently shape user behavior.
Lack of dynamic perspective: Against the backdrop of the rapid evolution of short video content, we need a snapshot of the current situation based on the latest data (such as 2025) to capture the behavioral characteristics of users at the current stage.

## The intended final products

(To provide practical short-video creation guidelines, such as recommended video duration ranges and strategies for improving viewer engagement and retention.)

## The anticipated data sources


## The planned analyses and visualizations
#### Exploratory Data Analysis
- Visualize the distribution of core performance metrics (completion rate and engagement rate) using histograms, density plots, and boxplots.<br/>
<div style="margin-bottom: 10px;"></div>
- Use scatter plots and correlation heat maps to examine relationships among different video characteristics and their performance results.

#### Regression Analysis
- Apply multiple regression models to identify which video characteristics significantly influence completion rate and engagement rate.<br/>
<div style="margin-bottom: 10px;"></div>
- Interpret coefficient direction and magnitude to understand how content attributes affect viewer retention and interaction.

#### Group Comparison Analysis
- Compare performance across different video content categories such as lifestyle, sport and music.<br/>
<div style="margin-bottom: 10px;"></div>
- Conduct duration-based subgroup comparisons by categorizing videos into length intervals (e.g., <15s, 15–30s, 30–60s, >60s) to evaluate how video duration affects viewer retention and determine whether there is an optimal video length range that maximizes completion rate and engagement performance.

#### Machine Learning Prediction
- Build predictive models for completion rate using Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.<br/>
<div style="margin-bottom: 10px;"></div>
- Evaluate and compare model performance to determine which model provides the most accurate predictions.<br/>
<div style="margin-bottom: 10px;"></div>
- visualize feature importance rankings to determine which content attributes contribute most strongly to viewer behavior.
